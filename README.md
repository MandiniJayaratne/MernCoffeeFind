# CoffeeFind ☕

**CoffeeFind** is a MERN web application where locals can share and explore favorite coffee spots. All users can view coffee places, while logged-in users can create, update, and delete entries in their accounts. Each user has a profile, with passwords securely hashed for privacy and security. 💡This project was my first practice in the MERN stack.

## Features ✨

- **View Coffee Places**: All users can browse coffee places shared by others.
- **User Accounts**: Registered users can create, edit, and remove their coffee places.
- **Profile Management**: Each user has a profile, with passwords securely stored using hashing.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Access to specific actions (create, update, delete) is restricted to logged-in users.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Frontend**: React.js ⚛️
- **Backend**: Node.js 🌐, Express.js 🚀
- **Database**: MongoDB 🗄️ (with Mongoose for ORM)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 🔐 for secure access control
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt 🔑 for secure storage
